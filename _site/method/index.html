<h2>Ping</h2>
          <p>
            Ping Practice assumes that within the tiny, everyday, and
            easy-to-dismiss moments of resonance are clues to new meaning and
            insight. Let’s call these “Pings.”
          </p>
          <p>
            A ping can take on any form: word, phrase, title, rhyme, name,
            lyric, quote, place, color, texture, melody, idea, feeling, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most important thing about Pings — and what differentiates them
            from other thoughts — is that a Ping is language that moves you,
            “clicks,” or otherwise causes you to feel something in your body.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are likely encountering a Ping if the attraction or resistance
            you sense seems intuitive, automatic, reflexive, and happens without
            thinking ... as if what you are encountering touches something
            latent within you.
          </p>
<p><h2>Practice</h2></p>
<p>Ping Practice is a 5-step method.</p>
<p><ol>
<li>
The first step is <b class="step">Sense</b>.<br /><br />
<i
                >This means being aware and present so that you can notice
things that “Ping” something within you.</i
              >
</li>
<br />
<li>
The second step follows quickly after the first:
<b class="step">Name</b>. <br /><br />
To name is to externalize the Ping in a way that your future self
can find its way back to the place in your mind-body where you
first noticed it.<br /><br />
The most important thing in this moment is to relieve yourself of
needing to know:<br /><br />
<ol>
<li><i>What — if anything — this Ping might mean</i></li>
<br />
<li><i>How — if at all — you might use this Ping</i></li>
</ol>
<br />
The ensuing steps will help you arrive at answers to the above.
</li>
<br />
<li>
The third step is to <b class="step">Revisit</b> previous Pings.
<br /><br />
<!-- <i
            >The cadence with which you revisit can vary. The most important
            thing is that you engage with your collection. This could mean:</i
          ><br /><br /> -->
<i
                >How and when you revisit will vary. The most important thing is
that you:</i
              ><br /><br />
<ol>
<li>
<u>Afford</u> yourself the space to explore and respond to
past Pings in ways that feel true to &quot;where&quot; you are in the
present moment.
</li>
<br />
</ol>
</li>
<li>
The fourth step is <b class="step">Create</b>.<br /><br />
<i
                >The purpose of Ping Practice is to turn the little things you
sense (Pings) into insights that you can apply/act on. A core
part of the “applying” part is making sure Pings are easy for
you to remember in the small windows you have opportunities to
apply them.</i
              ><br /><br />
This means two things:<br /><br />
<ol>
<li>
<u>Making Pings</u> that are important to you memorable so
that you can quickly recall them and
</li>
<br />
<li>
<u>Placing these Pings</u> where you will be able to easily
“reach” for them when you sense opportunities to act on them.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<br />
<li>
The last step — before the Ping Practice cycle repeats itself — is
<b class="step">Embody</b>.<br /><br />
<i
                >Taking the insights you have converged on and acting on them.
Doing so will cause you to Notice new things which starts the
cycle all over again.</i
              >
</li>
</ol></p>
