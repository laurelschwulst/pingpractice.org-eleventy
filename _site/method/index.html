<h1>Method</h1>

<p>Ping</p>
<p>Ping Practice assumes that within the tiny, everyday, and easy-to-dismiss moments of resonance are clues to new meaning and insight. Let’s call these “Pings.”</p>
<p>A ping can take on any form: word, phrase, title, rhyme, name, lyric, quote, place, color, texture, melody, idea, feeling, etc.</p>
<p>The most important thing about Pings — and what differentiates them from other thoughts — is that a Ping is language that moves you, “clicks,” or otherwise causes you to feel something in your body.</p>
<p>You are likely encountering a Ping if the attraction or resistance you sense seems intuitive, automatic, reflexive, and happens without thinking ... as if what you are encountering touches something latent within you.
Practice
Ping Practice is a 5-step method.</p>
<p>The first step is Sense.</p>
<p>This means being aware and present so that you can notice things that “Ping” something within you.</p>
<p>The second step follows quickly after the first: Name.</p>
<p>To name is to externalize the Ping in a way that your future self can find its way back to the place in your mind-body where you first noticed it.</p>
<p>The most important thing in this moment is to relieve yourself of needing to know:</p>
<p>What — if anything — this Ping might mean</p>
<p>How — if at all — you might use this Ping</p>
<p>The ensuing steps will help you arrive at answers to the above.</p>
<p>The third step is to Revisit previous Pings.</p>
<p>How and when you revisit will vary. The most important thing is that you:</p>
<p>Afford yourself the space to explore and respond to past Pings in ways that feel true to &quot;where&quot; you are in the present moment.</p>
<p>The fourth step is Create.</p>
<p>The purpose of Ping Practice is to turn the little things you sense (Pings) into insights that you can apply/act on. A core part of the “applying” part is making sure Pings are easy for you to remember in the small windows you have opportunities to apply them.</p>
<p>This means two things:</p>
<p>Making Pings that are important to you memorable so that you can quickly recall them and</p>
<p>Placing these Pings where you will be able to easily “reach” for them when you sense opportunities to act on them.</p>
<p>The last step — before the Ping Practice cycle repeats itself — is Embody.</p>
<p>Taking the insights you have converged on and acting on them. Doing so will cause you to Notice new things which starts the cycle all over again.</p>
