<h1>About</h1>

<p>Certain ideas sing. They resonate in our bodies, touch some invisible place within.</p>
<p>Sometimes we encounter these ideas out in the world. Other times, we hear them in our minds. Sometimes they are language, other times feelings or thoughts. Whatever they are — they’re meaningful energy.</p>
<p>In the Ping Practice universe, we call these resonances “Pings”. 1234</p>
<p>What — if anything — these “Pings” might mean and how we might use them is rarely clear in the moment. Their meaning often unfolds and evolves over time.</p>
<p>The fleeting nature of these Pings, and the uncertainty of their significance, can make deciding if and where to hold them (and how to work with them) unclear.</p>
<p>Ping Practice emerged precisely from this place.</p>
<p>Ping Practice is a journaling method and app designed to help you synthesize these fleeting bits of resonance into wisdom you are inspired and equipped to embody.</p>
<p>The method emerged through years of experimentation orbiting a central question:</p>
<p>How might I locate what I learn and experience in ways that equip me to apply them in the fleeting moments when I sense opportunities to do so?</p>
<p>Ping Practices continues to be shaped by an expansive body of pre-existing thought and through conversations with people who see making-meaning from what they experience as an act of survival.</p>
