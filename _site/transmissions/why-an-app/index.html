<h1 class="hidden">Why an app?</h1>

<h1 class="transmission" style="margin-bottom: 0.25em;">
  <span class="ping"></span> Why an app?
</h1>



<p>We’ve <a href="https://pingpractice.org/transmissions/what-is-a-ping/">previously explored</a> how Ping Practice is medium-agnostic.</p>
<p>That is, you can record, reflect on, and synthesize pings in whatever ways work for you.</p>
<p>Despite the abundance of existing methods, we still decided to build a bespoke phone app. Why?</p>
<hr>
<p>After years of <a href="https://ping-practice.gitbook.io/pings/experiments">experimenting</a> and <a href="https://ping-practice.gitbook.io/pings/conversations">talking with people</a> doing the same, we learned the ways people captured “placeless thoughts” varied.</p>
<p>At the same time, commonalities emerged among the different workflows and tools.</p>
<p>Whether people used Apple Notes, emailing/texting themselves, physical notebooks, plain text files, index cards, scrap pieces of paper, sticky notes, Google Docs, Simplenote, Squarespace Note (RIP), screenshots… we all aligned on tools that prioritized:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simplicity</li>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Convenience</li>
<li>Privacy</li>
</ol>
<p>All the while, no matter the medium or method, people described a tension:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>People felt grounded, clear, and inspired when they revisited what they had captured</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People rarely found room for this reflection</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This tension helped inform a variety of experiments – each of which concluded in a similar way: they failed to inspire us to revisit regularly.</p>
<p>No matter the configuration, revisiting felt heavy. As a result, doing so required a level of intention and motivation we experienced too infrequently to encourage an ongoing practice.</p>
<hr>
<p>We dreamt of a revisiting and reflecting experience that felt a bit like walking: lightweight, open-ended, easeful, impromptu, clarifying, and safe. An experience that worked both while you were waiting in line at the grocery store and sitting silently on a long flight.</p>
<p>Clear about what we were seeking and why, we raised our gaze and saw the space for a dedicated tool — an iOS app to start.</p>
<p>Ping Practice (the app) draws inspiration from the gradual meaning-making editing Wikipedia enables and the gestural and intuitive exploration Apple/Google Photos invites. At the same time, Ping Practice reimagines these experiences for the purpose of inner discovery.</p>
<p>We call it “a camera roll for your thoughts.”</p>
<p>To see how we’ve given <i>initial</i> shape to the above, we invite you to review this <a href="https://apossible.com/pages/ping-practice?token=678412c06424c4870162888457b32bee9d45a06e">case study</a> and/or <a href="https://forms.gle/52CsyyrqSrcwD5JM8">join us in experimenting</a> with the prototype.</p>
