What a ping might mean, and how/if you might utilize it, is rarely clear in the moment.

In this way, you can think of a Ping as a place to start from, and the metadata that accompanies each one, as a tool to help you find your way back when you’re open to reflect on the meaning that might lie there.
</p></p>
<p><!-- <p>
                You can recognize a ping by these qualities:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                  It's language flowing out of you. It feels automatic, reflexive, and true.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                  You don’t know where else to put this. You don’t know what it means or how to use it (yet).
                </li><br>
                <li>
                  It emerges in a specific moment in time & place — often unexpectedly, like when you're doing something else.
                </li>
            </ul> --></p>
<p><!-- In this way, it becomes a portal back to a specific moment in time & space. The metadata that accompanies each one becomes a tool to help you find your way back when you’re in the mood to reflect on its possible meaning, often in relationship to other pings. --></p>

Each ping typically has three parts:
</p></p>
<p><b>1 — Message</b>
<br>
<i>Recording or translation of the ping (in text), in whatever style is most useful for the recipient.
<!-- This is language that emerges to you, arrives in your field of view somehow. -->
</i><br>
<span class="small gray non-italic">Learning is the future</span>
<br><br></p>
<p><b>2 — Metadata</b>
<br>
<i>Pings are portals.
<!-- Each ping needs to include when & where it emerged, which creates possibility for pathways to other pings that have emerged in related moments -->
The metadata (including time and date) that accompanies each ping becomes a tool to help you find your way back when you’re in the mood to reflect on its possible meaning, often in relationship to other pings.

<br>
<span class="small gray">9:15am  •  Monday, July 22, 2024</span>
<br><br></p>
<p><b>3 — Practice</b>
<br>
<i>Each discrete ping is part of a larger practice. Sharing a ping ID paints a picture of this ping within your larger collection.</i>
