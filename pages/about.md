Certain ideas sing. They resonate in our bodies, touch some invisible place within.

Sometimes we encounter these ideas out in the world. Other times, we hear them in our minds. Sometimes they are language, other times feelings or thoughts. Whatever they are — they’re meaningful energy.

In the Ping Practice universe, we call these resonances “Pings”. 1234

What — if anything — these “Pings” might mean and how we might use them is rarely clear in the moment. Their meaning often unfolds and evolves over time.

The fleeting nature of these Pings, and the uncertainty of their significance, can make deciding if and where to hold them (and how to work with them) unclear.

Ping Practice emerged precisely from this place.

Ping Practice is a journaling method and app designed to help you synthesize these fleeting bits of resonance into wisdom you are inspired and equipped to embody.

The method emerged through years of experimentation orbiting a central question:

How might I locate what I learn and experience in ways that equip me to apply them in the fleeting moments when I sense opportunities to do so?

Ping Practices continues to be shaped by an expansive body of pre-existing thought and through conversations with people who see making-meaning from what they experience as an act of survival.
