              <span class="ping"></span> Why text?
            </h1>

<p> While some pings are pre-language, we believe text is the easiest to begin building with. Text felt intuitive to us. It is durable and lightweight. It’s by no means exhaustive, but it’s a simple way to start.
</p>

<hr>

<p><i>Said another way...</i></p>

<p>We think it’s important that you be able to capture pings in a medium you feel fluent within, can easily “reach,” and are practiced building with.</p>

<p>We also recognize that different people will find different mediums will hold these qualities for them.</p>

<p>For the initial <a href="/people" class="low-link">set of practitioners</a>, this medium is text. It’s durable, lightweight and by no means exhaustive. Though, it’s  a place to start.</p>
