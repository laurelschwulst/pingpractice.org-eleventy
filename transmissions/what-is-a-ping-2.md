<p>A ping is a tiny resonant message from the universe.</p>
          <div class="ping">
            <div class="ping-metadata variation hidden">9:15am &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Monday, July 22, 2024</div>
            <div class="ping-content">Learning is the future</div>
            <div class="ping-metadata id hidden">Ping 188 of 322 &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <span class="author">Laurel Schwulst</span></div>

             What a ping might mean, and how/if you might utilize it, is rarely clear in the moment. 
            <!-- Pings are unique for every person. In other words, no two people receive the exact same pings. That’s because pings emerge within specific yet everyday moments — -->

            <!-- Pings emerge from unique contexts, which include time and place, and are unique to the people who receive them.  -->
          </p>
          <div class="ping">
            <div class="ping-metadata variation">9:15am &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Monday, July 22, 2024</div>
            <div class="ping-content">Learning is the future</div>
            <div class="ping-metadata id">Ping 188 of 322 &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <span class="author">Laurel Schwulst</span></div>
          </div>
          <p>
           In this way, you can think of a Ping as a place to start from, and the metadata that accompanies each one, as a tool to help you find your way back when you’re open to reflect on the meaning that might exist within it.

            Each ping typically has three parts:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Time & Date</b>
              <br>
              <i>acknowledging the particular moment in time the ping occurred — local timestamp and date</i>
              <br>
              <span class="small gray">9:15am &nbsp;•&nbsp; Monday, July 22, 2024</span>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Ping Content</b>
              <br>
              <i>recording or translation of the ping (in text), in whatever style is most useful for the recipient</i><br>
              <span class="small gray non-italic">Learning is the future</span>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>ID & Author</b>
              <br>
              <i>sharing this ping’s place within the recipient’s more expansive “ping practice”</i>
              <br>
              <span class="small gray">Ping 188 of 322 &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <span class="author">Laurel Schwulst</span></span>
            </li>
          </ol>

            Depending on where pings live or are recorded, they may appear differently—
          </p>
          <figure class="photo">
            <img src="/assets/images/what-is-a-ping-app-simple-ripple.png">

          </figure>
          <p>By default, pings are internal, local to your inner world. That said, unless you publish a ping, your (author) name need not appear.</p>
          <figure class="photo">
            <img src="/assets/images/what-is-a-ping-journal-square.jpg">

          </figure>
          <p>If you record pings with pen & paper, you may only have time to jot down the date. This can still be useful, so use whatever medium(s) best suit you.</p>
          <figure class="photo">
            <img src="/assets/images/what-is-a-ping-notes-app.png">

          </figure>
          <p>
              Relatedly, you can use existing notes apps for pings, simply by using the word “ping.” Later on, after multiple pings have accumulated, searching for the word “ping” allows oneself to look through past pings.
            </p>

            We are particularly excited about a bespoke phone <a href="/app" class="low-link">app</a> or related networked technology because it can automatically capture and record contextual metadata, which becomes useful over time.
          </p>
          <p>
          For example, here are pings which all happen to be recorded on a <i>Monday</i>:
          </p>
          <figure class="photo">
            <img src="/assets/images/what-is-a-ping-app-simple-mondays.png">
          </figure>
          <p>In our tool, metadata is an important bridge. Most metadata is tappable and traversable. That way, each ping becomes a pathway or portal to others related to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            This way, your future self can more easily traverse your past pings—by day of week, by time of day, by weather—and so on, and so forth.
        </p>
        <!-- <p><i>This simple metadata traversal is merely the beginning, and we look forward to building this tool further to continue encouraging reflection and recirculation. We welcome your ideas.</i> -->
        <p>
        Here is another ping which was recorded on a <i>Monday</i>, but three years ago:
          </p>

            <div class="ping medium">
              <div class="ping-metadata variation">11:54am &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Monday, September 19, 2022</div>
              <div class="ping-content">peters app should be called “ping”</div>
              <div class="ping-metadata id">Ping 2 of 322 &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <span class="author">Laurel Schwulst</span></div>
            </div>

          <p>
            We have faith that there will be some small number of pings that you want to share—either with another person, a group of people, or even more publicly—to refer to over time.
          </p>

            I’ve been thinking about what it means to get a “ping from the universe,” and how that's a helpful metaphor for the whisper of intuition. Having that name is really helpful. Because when I get a good idea, I think to myself, “Oh, I know what that is. That's a ping from the universe.” And I can note it down.<br><br>
