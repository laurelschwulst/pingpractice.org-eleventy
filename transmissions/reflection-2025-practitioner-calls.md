Last April, five of us gathered for, what would become, the first of four “Ping Practitioner” calls in 2025.

In that initial April conversation, we experimented with an exercise that we carried into each subsequent one.<sup>1</sup>

In April and June, this exercise served as an introduction: to each other, and to the place we were meeting in. A series of prompts followed that directed us elsewhere.<sup>2</sup>

In August and November, we tried something different.

Rather than moving on from the Pings we’d shared, we stayed with them. People started asking questions. The questions led to stories, and the stories surfaced patterns and reflections that seemed to resonate across the room.

This all felt like flight: lightness, harmony, propulsion, clarity, fluidity…movement.

The scaffolding of Ping Practice had disappeared. We were talking, and crucially, learning from one another about creating in the ways Ping Practice speaks to.

While Ping Practice began as an internal practice, 2025 helped reveal to me how generative and connecting it can be.<sup>3</sup>

               This exercise invited each person to revisit the Pings they had captured, select one that resonated, and place it on a slide for the group to see. Along with the Ping each person had chosen, the exercise asked everyone to share a lightweight reflection about the Ping they were showing and what had moved them to join that day’s conversation.</li><br>
               <li> Namely, towards discussions about the mechanics of the app and method.</li><br>
