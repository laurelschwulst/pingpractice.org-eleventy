              What a ping might mean, and how/if you might utilize it, is rarely clear in the moment.
            </p>

              <div class="ping-metadata variation">9:15am &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Monday, July 22, 2024</div>

              In this way, you can think of a Ping as a place to start from, and the metadata that accompanies each one, as a tool to help you find your way back when you’re open to reflect on the meaning that might lie there.
            </p>

            <!-- <p>
                You can recognize a ping by these qualities:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                  It's language flowing out of you. It feels automatic, reflexive, and true.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                  You don’t know where else to put this. You don’t know what it means or how to use it (yet).
                </li><br>
                <li>
                  It emerges in a specific moment in time & place — often unexpectedly, like when you're doing something else.
                </li>
            </ul> -->


            <!-- In this way, it becomes a portal back to a specific moment in time & space. The metadata that accompanies each one becomes a tool to help you find your way back when you’re in the mood to reflect on its possible meaning, often in relationship to other pings. -->

              Each ping typically has three parts:
            </p>

                <b>1 — Message</b>
                <br>
                <i>Recording or translation of the ping (in text), in whatever style is most useful for the recipient.
                  <!-- This is language that emerges to you, arrives in your field of view somehow. -->
                </i><br>
                <span class="small gray non-italic">Learning is the future</span>
              <br><br>


                <b>2 — Metadata</b>
                <br>
                <i>Pings are portals.
                  <!-- Each ping needs to include when & where it emerged, which creates possibility for pathways to other pings that have emerged in related moments -->
                  The metadata (including time and date) that accompanies each ping becomes a tool to help you find your way back when you’re in the mood to reflect on its possible meaning, often in relationship to other pings.
                </i>
                <br>
                <span class="small gray">9:15am &nbsp;•&nbsp; Monday, July 22, 2024</span>
              <br><br>

                <b>3 — Practice</b>
                <br>
                <i>Each discrete ping is part of a larger practice. Sharing a ping ID paints a picture of this ping within your larger collection.</i>
                <br>

            <p>Something here about us making an <a href="transmission-app.html">app</a> with a link?</p>

            <i>Should we also link to the <a href="#method" class="method-link">method</a> here, for the record?</i>
