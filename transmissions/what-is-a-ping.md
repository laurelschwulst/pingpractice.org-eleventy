<p>A Ping is a tiny resonant message from the universe. </p>
          <div class="ping">
            <div class="ping-metadata variation hidden">9:15am &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Monday, July 22, 2024</div>
            <div class="ping-content">Learning is the future</div>
            <div class="ping-metadata id hidden">Ping 188 of 322</div>
          </div>
          <p>
             What a Ping might mean, and how/if you might use it is rarely clear in the moment.

            <!-- Pings emerge from unique contexts, which include time and place, and are unique to the people who receive them.  -->
          </p>
          <div class="ping">
            <div class="ping-metadata variation">9:15am &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Monday, July 22, 2024</div>
            <div class="ping-content">Learning is the future</div>
            <div class="ping-metadata id">Ping 188 of 322</div>
          </div>
          <p>
           In this way, you can think of a Ping as a place to start from, and the metadata that accompanies each one, as markers to help you find your way back when you’re open to reflecting.

            Pings are typically made up of three parts:
          </p>
          <ol>

          <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
              <b>Ping Content</b>
              <br>
              <i>recording or translation of the Ping (in text, for now), in whatever style is most useful for you (the receiver).</i><br>
              <span class="small gray non-italic">Learning is the future</span>
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
              <b>Time & Date</b>
              <br>
              <i>acknowledging the particular moment in time you received the Ping — local timestamp and date.</i>
              <br>
              <span class="small gray">9:15am &nbsp;•&nbsp; Monday, July 22, 2024</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>ID</b>
              <br>
              <i>marking this Ping’s place within the broader practice you maintain.</i>
              <br>
              <span class="small gray">Ping 188 of 322</span></span>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
        *
        </p>
          <p>
            You might handle Pings differently, depending on where you record them —
          </p>

          <figure class="photo" alt="a journal the size of a phone has a page open that reads in green handwriting 'Learning is the future'">
            <img src="/assets/images/what-is-a-ping-journal-square.jpg">

          </figure>

          <p>If you record Pings with pen & paper, there may only be time to jot down the content and date.</p>

          <figure class="photo" alt="a screenshot of a typical notes app on a computer with the word 'ping' searched for and manhy results surfacing">
            <img src="/assets/images/what-is-a-ping-notes-app.png">

          </figure>

          <p>If you record Pings using existing notes apps, consider including the word “Ping” along with each capture. Later on, searching for the word “Ping” will reveal the set of energetic messages you have captured over time.</p>

            <figure class="photo" alt="a screenshot of the Ping Practice app with 'Learning is the future' shown as a ping with metadata">

          <p>
              If you’re experimenting with the </span><a target="_blank" href="https://pingpractice.org/app/">app</a> we’re developing (or </span><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Aa1w-QsuuN9waNCW_UCEq925PwrJQ3QTEe3NDQVbpfA/edit">would like to</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">), you’ll notice Pings are packaged automatically — in other words, you can surf them according to different metadata that’s automatically recorded.
            </p>

          <p>
          Making the choice to record a Ping – be it with software or paper – enhances your reception, so use whatever medium(s) best suit you.
          </p>

<p>
And remember, hearing Pings depends on a willingness to:
</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Decouple sensing from sense-making</li>
<li>Believe that within (and between) Pings lies clues to new meaning and insight</li>
</ul>

              Nature, or the body itself, serves as a capable guide. But this subtle guidance goes unheard by most people because of the clamor caused by desire and by the activity of the discriminating mind.

            I’ve been thinking about what it means to get a “ping from the universe,” and how that's a helpful metaphor for the whisper of intuition. Having that name is really helpful. Because when I get a good idea, I think to myself, “Oh, I know what that is. That's a ping from the universe.” And I can note it down.<br><br>
