<p>When we originally started this writing over six months ago, we described Ping Practice as:</p>


<div class="ping extra-large">
  <div class="ping-content">A camera roll for your thoughts –</div>
  <div class="ping-metadata id">What is Ping Practice? &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; 1 of 3</div>
  <div class="ping-metadata variation">August 15, 2024</div>
</div>

<div class="ping large">
  <div class="ping-content">Ping Practice is a not-for-profit journaling method & app –</div>
  <div class="ping-metadata id">What is Ping Practice? &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; 2 of 3</div>
  <div class="ping-metadata variation">August 15, 2024</div>
</div>

<div class="ping large">
  <div class="ping-content">Meant to help you carry a conversation with yourself across time...</div>
  <div class="ping-metadata id">What is Ping Practice? &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; 3 of 3</div>
  <div class="ping-metadata variation">August 15, 2024</div>
</div>

<p>This all remains true —</p>

<p>Ping Practice is an evolving journaling <a href="/method" class="low-link">methodology</a> and <a href="/app" class="low-link">app</a>. Its basis are pings.<sup>1</sup></p>

<hr>

<p>Circling back to Ping Practice now, we’d like to offer an additional frame…</p>

<p>Ping Practice is a series of <i>invitations:</i></p>

<div class="ping extra-large">
  <div class="ping-content">See language as an energetic force</div>
  <div class="ping-metadata id">Ping Practice Invitation &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; 1 of 3</div>
  <div class="ping-metadata variation">March 15, 2025</div>
</div>

<div class="ping extra-large">
  <div class="ping-content">Add distance between noticing and knowing</div>
  <div class="ping-metadata id">Ping Practice Invitation &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; 2 of 3</div>
  <div class="ping-metadata variation">March 15, 2025</div>
</div>

<div class="ping extra-large">
  <div class="ping-content">Trust meaning to reveal itself when ready</div>
  <div class="ping-metadata id">Ping Practice Invitation &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; 3 of 3</div>
  <div class="ping-metadata variation">March 15, 2025</div>
</div>

<div class="ping extra-large">
  <div class="ping-content">Ground in the certainty within</div>
  <div class="ping-metadata id">Ping Practice Invitation &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; 3 of 3</div>
  <div class="ping-metadata variation">March 15, 2025</div>
</div>

<div class="ping extra-large">
  <div class="ping-content">Move by trying new choices</div>
  <div class="ping-metadata id">Ping Practice Invitation &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; 3 of 3</div>
  <div class="ping-metadata variation">March 15, 2025</div>
</div>

<p>We call these “invitations” because doing so reminds us of the posture we maintain: offering Ping Practice openly and without expectation, as something to try out and evaluate for oneself what’s useful.</p>

<p>Taken together, these invitations are about “repatterning” — expanding the ways we respond to what we feel and engage with the wider world and the beings we share it with.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ping Practice takes seriously the fact that no two journeys through this practice look the same —</p>

<p>As such, the <a href="/method" class="low-link">methodology</a> and <a href="/app" class="low-link">app</a> are not fixed. Rather, they are scaffolding: starting structures to support you in discovering what moves you to live these invitations and ultimately, thrive in the uncertainty of an open, ongoing, and creative existence.</p>

<p>This project, and the exploration it invites, is at once personal and communal.</p>

<p><i>If you would like to be made aware when we are hosting a conversation with people experimenting with Ping Practice, <a href="https://forms.gle/PYSr3mLY2WwUAAHa6" target="_blank">please be in touch</a></i>.</p>

<hr>

We quite like the form Viktor Frankl (<a href="https://www.viktorfrankl.org/quote_stimulus.html" target="_blank">source not known</a>) brought to the space Ping Practice is meant to help you develop the capacity for creating:

<blockquote>Between stimulus and response lies a space. In that space lie our freedom and power to choose a response. In our response lies our growth and our happiness.</blockquote>
