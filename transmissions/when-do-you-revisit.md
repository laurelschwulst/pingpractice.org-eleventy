We capture Pings without expectations.

When we are capturing Pings, we are receiving, listening, *[Sensing](https://pingpractice.org/method/)*.

We are also intentional – choosing to notice and defer the uncertainty that can accompany Pings: *What does this mean? What do I do now? How will I use this?*

Slowing down enough to embody this intention can take, well, practice.

[The method](https://pingpractice.org/method/) grounds its guidance for us to set aside this potential pull towards immediate knowing in the assumption that there will be a time and place for us to welcome it: when we revisit.

Revisiting can take on many forms.

Maybe it’s taking a moment on a Monday to scroll back through Pings from previous Tuesdays. Or maybe searching for Pings that mention the name of a friend you’ll soon be seeing. Or scrolling Pings from “last week” when you want to meet a *“How are you?”* you’re expecting with an earnest answer.

The [June and August (2025) Practitioners Calls](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeVAXbCplH75NaRmaFCYJ8chI9GSPc2MKe3VQttUVBomDETTg/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=115658284533241088477) clarified how energized many of us are to learn about revisiting techniques, and ways of thinking about it, from one another.

If reflecting on revisiting feels energizing, we invite you to visit this form:[ https://forms.gle/1B3gv1AbZHf2yhMN8](https://forms.gle/1B3gv1AbZHf2yhMN8)

Later on, we’ll publish a Transmission with the reflections Practitioners offer.
