*Pings can take on “any form” \*and\* what are some examples? How might you describe what the arrival of a Ping can feel like? How (and in what ways) are you moving from Pings into meaning and movement? As you find a rhythm with Ping Practice, what do you see and feel shifting?*

These questions are drawn from the existing body of documentation that *describes* Ping Practice.<sup>1</sup>


Descriptions that I’ve seen helpful in establishing a place. Ground. Somewhere we can meet and locate one another. And descriptions I sense needing support to offer the specificity and understanding I perceive these questions to be reaching for.

Last April, 5 of us gathered for, what would become, the first of 4 “Ping Practitioner” calls ## of us joined in 2025.

During that initial April conversation, we experimented with an exercise that we ended up carrying through to the start of each subsequent one.<sup>2</sup> 

In the April and June conversations, this exercise served as an introduction: to each other, and to the place we were meeting in. A series of prompts followed that directed us, and the conversation, elsewhere.<sup>3</sup>  

In August and November, we tried something different. Rather than moving on from the Pings we’d shared, we stayed with them. People started asking questions.<sup>4</sup>  These questions led to stories and these stories led to patterns and techniques that seemed to resonate across the room.<sup>5</sup> 

This all felt like flight: lightness, expansion, propulsion, fluidity, alignment, movement. 

The scaffolding of Ping Practice had disappeared. We were talking and crucially, learning with one another about what it can look and feel like to create from a way of experiencing life that I think Ping Practice speaks to.

               <li>This exercise invited each person to revisit the Pings they had captured, select one that resonated, and place it on a slide for the group to see. Along with the Ping each person had chosen, the exercise asked everyone to share a lightweight reflection about the Ping they were showing and what had moved them to join that day’s conversation.</li><br>
