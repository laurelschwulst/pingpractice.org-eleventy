*Pings can take on a range of forms \*and\* what are some examples? What can the arrival of a Ping feel like to you? How are you moving from Pings into meaning and movement? As you find a rhythm with Ping Practice, what do you see and feel shifting?*

<hr>

These questions are drawn from the existing body of documentation that *describes* Ping Practice.<sup>1</sup>

Descriptions that I’ve seen helpful in establishing a place. Ground. Somewhere we can meet one another. And descriptions I sense needing compliments to offer the understanding I perceive these questions to be reaching for.
<hr>
Last April, 5 of us gathered for, what would become, the first of 4 “Ping Practitioner” calls ## of us joined in 2025.

During that initial April conversation, we experimented with an exercise that we ended up carrying through to the start of each subsequent one.<sup>2</sup> 

In the April and June conversations, this exercise served as an introduction: to each other, and to the place we were meeting in. A series of prompts followed that directed us elsewhere.<sup>3</sup>  

In August and November, we tried something different. Rather than moving on from the Pings we’d shared, we stayed with them. People started asking questions.<sup>4</sup>  These questions led to stories and these stories led to patterns and techniques that seemed to resonate across the room.<sup>5</sup> 

This all felt like flight: lightness, expansion, propulsion, fluidity, alignment, movement. 

The scaffolding of Ping Practice had disappeared. We were talking and crucially, learning with one another about what it can look and feel like to create in ways Ping Practice speaks to.

<hr>

The above feels clear to me. What remains a puzzle, and consistent point of curiosity, are the formats and containers that Pings – outside of our internal practices – might thrive within.

As a step in this direction, I’ve recorded a few videos:
→ Video #1
→ Video #2
→ Video #3

“Pings in Practice” as I'm calling it, is an attempt to bring some concreteness to what this all can look and feel like.

I feel deeply energized by the prospect of other people contributing. So, if any ideas emerge for you, I hope you will be in touch.

               <li>This exercise invited each person to revisit the Pings they had captured, select one that resonated, and place it on a slide for the group to see. Along with the Ping each person had chosen, the exercise asked everyone to share a lightweight reflection about the Ping they were showing and what had moved them to join that day’s conversation.</li><br>
