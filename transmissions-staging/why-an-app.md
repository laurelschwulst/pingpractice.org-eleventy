            <p>A smartphone app is just one of many tools in everyday life. Like other apps, it has pros and cons.</p>

            <p>In the world of pings, you can record them in whatever way is useful to you. You can use pen & paper, an existing notes app, or something else. Or maybe you even decide pings aren't worth recording and that is their power...</p>

            <p>We are currently building an app, and we will do our best to share why —</p>

            <p>*</p>

            <p>
            We are particularly excited about a bespoke phone <a href="/app" class="low-link">app</a> or related networked technology because it can automatically capture and record contextual metadata, which becomes useful over time.
          </p>
          <p>
          For example, here are pings which all happen to be recorded on a <i>Monday</i>:
          </p>
          <figure class="photo">
            <img src="/assets/images/what-is-a-ping-app-simple-mondays.png">
          </figure>
          <p>In our tool, metadata is an important bridge. Most metadata is tappable and traversable. That way, each ping becomes a pathway or portal to others related to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            This way, your future self can more easily traverse your past pings — by day of week, by time of day, by weather — and so on, and so forth.
        </p>
        <!-- <p><i>This simple metadata traversal is merely the beginning, and we look forward to building this tool further to continue encouraging reflection and recirculation. We welcome your ideas.</i> -->
        <p>
        Here is another ping which was recorded on a <i>Monday</i>, but three years ago:
          </p>

            <div class="ping medium">
              <div class="ping-metadata variation">11:54am &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Monday, September 19, 2022</div>
              <div class="ping-content">peters app should be called “ping”</div>
              <div class="ping-metadata id">Ping 2 of 322 &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <span class="author">Laurel Schwulst</span></div>
            </div>

          <p>
            We have faith that there will be some small number of pings that you want to share — either with another person, a group of people, or even more publicly — to refer to over time.
          </p>
