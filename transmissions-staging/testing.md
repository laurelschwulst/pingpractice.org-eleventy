We think it is important that you be able to capture Pings in a medium:

1. You feel fluent in
2. Is usually within reach
3. Serves the art you are making

We also think the above will mean different mediums for different people.

For the initial set of practitioners, this medium is text. It is durable, lightweight, and serves the writing we do.

While text is by no means exhaustive, it is somewhere to start from.
