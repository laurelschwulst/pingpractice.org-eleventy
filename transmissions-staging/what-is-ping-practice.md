<p>When we originally started this writing over six months ago, we described Ping Practice as:</p>


<div class="ping medium">
  <div class="ping-content">A camera roll for your thoughts –</div>
</div>

<div class="ping medium">
  <div class="ping-content">Ping Practice is a not-for-profit journaling app & method –</div>
</div>

<div class="ping medium">
  <div class="ping-content">Meant to help you carry a conversation with yourself across time...</div>
</div>

<p>This all remains true. Ping Practice is an evolving journaling <a href="/method" class="low-link">methodology</a> and <a href="/app" class="low-link">app</a>. Its basis are pings.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>*</p>

<p>However, circling back to what Ping Practice is now, we’d like to offer an additional frame…</p>

<p>Ping Practice is a series of <i>invitations:</i></p>

<div class="ping medium">
  <div class="ping-content">See language as a living force</div>
</div>

<div class="ping medium">
  <div class="ping-content">Add distance between noticing and knowing</div>
</div>

<div class="ping medium">
  <div class="ping-content">Treat meaning as malleable</div>
</div>

<p>We call these “invitations” because doing so reminds us of the posture we maintain: offering Ping Practice openly and without expectation, as something to try out and evaluate for oneself what’s resonant and/or useful.</p>

<p>Taken together, these invitations are about “repatterning” — expanding the ways we respond to what we feel and engage with the wider world and the beings we share it with.</p>

<p>Ping Practice takes seriously the fact that no two journeys through this practice look the same —</p>

<p>As such, the method and app are not fixed. They are scaffolding: starting structures to support you in discovering what moves you to live these invitations and ultimately, thrive in the uncertainty of an open, ongoing, and creative existence.</p>

<p>This project, and the exploration it invites, is at once personal and communal.</p>
