We capture Pings without expectations. 

When we are capturing Pings, we are receiving, listening, *sensing*.

We are also intent. 

Intent on choosing to notice and defer the uncertainty that can accompany Pings: *What might this mean? Is this one? What ‘should’ I do with this now?*

Slowing down enough to embody this intention can take, well, practice. 

[The method](https://pingpractice.org/method/) grounds its guidance for us to set aside this pull towards meaning in the assumption that there will be a time and place for us to welcome it: when we revisit.

*So, when do you revisit Pings? Where are you? How are you going back through them? What impact do you notice revisiting having?*
