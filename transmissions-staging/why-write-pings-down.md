Capturing Pings can offer a feeling of lightness that comes from seeing:

1. A resonant place more clearly
2. An intrusive Ping disappear <sup>\[i]</sup>

In both cases, capturing can relieve a tension:  *“I want to remember this later and release it right now.”* <sup>\[ii]</sup> Left unattended to, this tension could interfere with being present with the moment the Ping met you in.

Capturing also creates the potential to revisit Pings, and in doing so:

1. See how they (and you) evolve 
2. Sense the themes that exist within Pings 
3. Ultimately, discover what Pings remain true for you

Browsing past Pings can also help you take a step back and see the thoughts, feelings, ideas, and moods you experience as the energetic flows that they are.

The metadata the [Ping Practice app](https://pingpractice.org/transmissions/why-an-app/) automatically associates with each Ping supports this act. This information grounds Pings in time which can provide a durable scaffolding for navigating Pings and understanding how they relate to the embodied moments we meet Pings in.

As we talk about all of this, it’s important to name another tension: capturing Pings has the potential to support presence as much as it can interfere with it.

Sometimes noticing a Ping is enough. Other times, capturing a Ping deepens our awareness in ways noticing alone may not.

An integral part of Ping Practice is learning what proves true for you and making creative choices in alignment with these inner places.

<small>i. This “disappearing” refers specifically to the capture experience within the Ping Practice app. *Watch [13 second demo](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o2cSMp6JDlU)*.</small>

<small>ii. I think it’s important to unpack, without judgement, how some of us have come to A) question our  capacity to remember and/or B) become fearful of forgetting. For now, Ping Practice accepts us and see these responses as reflections of the dominant contexts we currently interface with.</small>
