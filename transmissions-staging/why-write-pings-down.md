Capturing Pings can offer a feeling of lightness brought on by:

1. Drawing a 'line' around a felt place
2. Seeing an intrusive Ping disappear <sup>\[i]</sup>

In both cases, the act of capturing can settle a concern -  *“Will I remember this?”* <sup>\[ii]</sup> – which if left unattended could interfere with being present with the work, conversation, play, view, walk, moment, etc. the Ping met you in.

Capturing also creates the potential to revisit Pings and in doing so:

1. Notice what a Ping does/does not  bring up over time
2. Learn what Pings continue to resonate
3. Develop a sense for the themes that exist within Pings 
4. Ultimately, discover what Pings to integrate and how

Browsing through Pings can also help you take a step back and see the thoughts, feelings, ideas, and moods you experience as the dynamic flow that they are.

The metadata the Ping Practice app automatically associates with each Ping supports this act. This information grounds Pings in time which can provide a reliable scaffolding for navigating Pings and understanding how they relate to the lived moments we meet Pings in.

As we talk about all of this, it’s important to name a tension: capturing Pings has the potential to support presence as much as it can interfere with it.

Sometimes noticing a Ping is enough. Other times, capturing a Ping deepens our awareness in ways noticing alone may not.

An integral part of Ping Practice is noticing what you sense and making an *intentional* choice from that place.

<small>i. This “disappearing” refers specifically to the capture experience within the Ping Practice app. See 15-second demo.</small>

<small>ii. I think it’s important to unpack, without judgement, how some of us have come to A) question our  capacity to remember and/or B) become fearful of forgetting. For now, Ping Practice accepts us and see these responses as reflections of the dominant contexts we exist within right now.</small>
