Capturing Pings can offer a feeling of lightness/relief brought on by:

1. Making a felt place a bit more visible
2. Seeing an intrusive Ping disappear <sup>\[i]</sup>

In both cases, the act of capturing can settle a concern -  *“Will I remember this?”* <sup>\[ii]</sup> – which if left unattended could interfere with being present with the work, conversation, play, view, walk, moment, etc. the Ping met you in.

Capturing Pings also creates potential. The potential to revisit them and in doing so:


1. Experience the feeling(s) a Ping does/does not  bring up over time
2. Learn what Pings continue to resonate
3. Develop a sense for the themes that exist within Pings 
4. Ultimately, discover what and how to pursue further and how to integrate them

Browsing through Pings can also help you take a step back and see the thoughts, feelings, ideas, and moods you experience as a flow that is distinct from "you." 

The metadata the Ping Practice app automatically captures with each Ping supports this act. This information grounds Pings in time which can provide a durable scaffolding for navigating Pings, sequencing them, and understanding how they relate to the lived moments we greet Pings in.

As we talk about all of this, it’s important to name a tension: capturing Pings has the potential to support presence as much as it can interfere with it.

Sometimes noticing a Ping is enough. Other times, recording a Ping adds a welcomed amount of weight that noticing alone may not.

An integral part of Ping Practice is discovering what you need when and making an intentional choice from this place.

<small>i. This “disappearing” refers specifically to the capture experience within the Ping Practice app. Watch 15-second demo.</small>

<small>ii. I think it’s important to unpack, without judgement, how some of us have come to A) question our innate capacity to remember and/or B) become fearful of forgetting. For now, Ping Practice accepts us and see these responses as reflections of the dominant contexts we exist within.</small>
