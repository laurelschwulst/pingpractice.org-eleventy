<p>A Ping is a tiny resonant message from the universe. Energetic information without intrinsic valence.</p>
          <div class="ping">
            <div class="ping-metadata variation hidden">9:15am &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Monday, July 22, 2024</div>
            <div class="ping-content">Learning is the future</div>
            <div class="ping-metadata id hidden">Ping 188 of 322 &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <span class="author">Laurel Schwulst</span></div>

             What a Ping might mean, and how/if you might use it, is rarely clear in the moment. 
            <!-- Pings are unique for every person. In other words, no two people receive the exact same pings. That’s because pings emerge within specific yet everyday moments — -->

            <!-- Pings emerge from unique contexts, which include time and place, and are unique to the people who receive them.  -->
          </p>
          <div class="ping">
            <div class="ping-metadata variation">9:15am &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Monday, July 22, 2024</div>
            <div class="ping-content">Learning is the future</div>

           In this way, you can think of a Ping as a place to start from, and the metadata that accompanies each one, as a tool to help you find your way back when you’re open to reflect on the meaning that might exist within and between them.

            Each ping typically has three parts:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Time & Date</b>
              <br>
              <i>acknowledging the particular moment in time you received the Ping — local timestamp and date</i>
              <br>
              <span class="small gray">9:15am &nbsp;•&nbsp; Monday, July 22, 2024</span>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Ping Content</b>
              <br>
              <i>recording or translation of the Ping (in text), in whatever style is most useful for you, the receiver</i><br>
              <span class="small gray non-italic">Learning is the future</span>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>ID & Author</b>
              <br>
              <i>sharing this Ping;s place within the receiver's broader “Ping Practice”</i>
              <br>
              <span class="small gray">Ping 188 of 322 &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <span class="author">Laurel Schwulst</span></span>

            Depending on where you record Pings, they may appear differently—

          <p>By default, Pings are meant to be internal, local to your inner world.  <!-- That said, unless you publish a ping, your (author) name need not appear.</p> -->

          <p>If you record Pings with pen & paper, you may only have time to jot down the date. This can still be useful, so use whatever medium(s) best suit you.</p>

              Relatedly, you can use existing notes apps for Pings, simply by using the word “Ping.” Later on, after multiple Pings have accumulated, searching for the word “Ping” allows you to look through past Pings.

Regardless of where you record Pings, we are ready to receive them when we are open, available to feel. Ping Practices challenge the notion that sensing and

            I’ve been thinking about what it means to get a “ping from the universe,” and how that's a helpful metaphor for the whisper of intuition. Having that name is really helpful. Because when I get a good idea, I think to myself, “Oh, I know what that is. That's a ping from the universe.” And I can note it down.<br><br>
