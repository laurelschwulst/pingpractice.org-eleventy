<p>A Ping is a tiny resonant message from the universe.</p>
          <div class="ping">
            <div class="ping-metadata variation hidden">9:15am &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Monday, July 22, 2024</div>
            <div class="ping-content">Learning is the future</div>
            <div class="ping-metadata id hidden">Ping 188 of 322 &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <span class="author">Laurel Schwulst</span></div>
          </div>
          <p>
             What a Ping might mean, and how/if you might use it is rarely clear in the moment. 
          </p>
          <div class="ping">
            <div class="ping-metadata variation">9:15am &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Monday, July 22, 2024</div>
            <div class="ping-content">Learning is the future</div>
            <div class="ping-metadata id">Ping 188 of 322 &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <span class="author">Laurel Schwulst</span></div>
          </div>
          <p>
          In this way, you can think of a Ping as a place to start from, and the metadata that accompanies each one, as markers to help you find your way back when you’re open to reflecting.

            Pings are typically made up of three parts:
          </p>
          <ol>
    <li>
              <b>Ping Content</b>
              <br>
              <i>recording or translation of the Ping (in text, for now), in whatever style is most useful for you, the receiver.</i><br>
              <span class="small gray non-italic">Learning is the future</span>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Time & Date</b>
              <br>
              <i>acknowledging the particular moment in time you received the Ping — local timestamp and date</i>
              <br>
              <span class="small gray">9:15am &nbsp;•&nbsp; Monday, July 22, 2024</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>ID</b>
              <br>
              <i>sharing this Ping’s referenceable place within the receiver’s broader practice</i>
              <br>
              <span class="small gray">Ping 188</span>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
        *
        </p>
          <p>
            You might handle Pings differently, depending on where you record them—
          </p>

          </figure> 
        
          <p>
If you record Ping with pen & paper, there may only be time to jot down the content and date. 
</p> 
<p>
Choosing to record a Ping – be it with your hands or thumbs – helps build your awareness, so use whatever medium(s) best suit you.</p>

          <p>
              If you record Pings using existing notes apps, consider including the word “Ping” along with each capture. Later on, after you have recorded multiple Pings, searching for the word “Ping” will reveal the set of energetic messages you have captured over time.

If you're experimenting with the <a href="https://pingpractice.org/app/" target="_blank">app</a> we’re developing, you'll notice Pings are packaged automatically. 

</p>
     <p>
Regardless of where you record Pings, "hearing" them depends on an open posture and a willingness to try on the idea that sensing and making sense can happen in different moments.

We resonate with how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masanobu_Fukuoka">Masanobu Fukuoka</a> puts it in <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/one-straw-revolution-an-introduction-to-natural-farming/oclc/251203919">The One-Straw Revolution (1975): </a> </p>

"Nature, or the body itself, serves as a capable guide. But this subtle guidance goes unheard by most people because of the clamor caused by desire and by the activity of the discriminating mind."
